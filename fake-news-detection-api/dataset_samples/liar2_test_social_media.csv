7743,2,Says Ken Cuccinelli supported a law that could allow people to carry missile launchers into airports.,"August 23, 2013",homeland security;guns,terry mcauliffe,"Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, was elected governor of Virginia on Nov. 5, 2013. He received 47.8 percent of the vote in defeating Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who came in at 45.2 percent. Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian, finished a distant third with 6.5 percent.
McAuliffe's inaguration as Virginia's 72nd governor is scheduled on Jan. 11, 2014.
McAuliffe, a wealthy businessman and noted political fundraiser, was co-chairman of President Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign. He was chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2001 to 2005 and chairman of Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008. In 2009, McAuliffe unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for Virginia governor.
McAuliffe was born in Syracuse, N.Y., on Feb. 9, 1957. He has a bachelor's degree from The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C., and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C. McAuliffe has lived in Fairfax County for more than 20 years, is married and has five children.

In 2004, Cuccinelli was one of 16 people in the 40-member state Senate that voted against a bill barring people from entering an airport terminal carrying a ""gun or other weapon designed or intended to propel a missile or projectile of any kind."" It can be argued that the description does  encompass missile launchers, but that’s an interpretation that doesn’t weigh the debate at the time the bill was considered. A 2004 news article said Senate opponents were concerned that the bill undercut the rights of some gun owners. The article made no mention of missile launchers. McAuliffe’s tweet focuses on the term ""missile"" and suggests that the bill’s purpose was to ban warheads from airports. But the term ""missile"" is undefined in state law and could mean bullets, rocks, or even a cup of soda if it’s thrown maliciously. So there’s a trace of  to a deeply distorted and inflamed statement by McAuliffe. We rate his  ."

Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post.
