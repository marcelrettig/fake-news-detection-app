We've probably all put something in an online shopping cart, thought about it for a couple minutes, decided not to buy it and left it sitting there. If that same scenario occurs on healthcare.gov, does the White House consider a person enrolled? No. For a person to be considered enrolled, they must have submitted their application for health insurance. That information is transmitted to the federal government and the private insurance company. In a literal sense, that’s more than just popping something into an online shopping cart a la Amazon.  Trump also is guilty of oversimplifying a highly regulated private industry. While some insurance companies accept online payments and give Obamacare enrollees the option to pay immediately, many do not. In the Virginia-Maryland market for example, most companies mail bills to the new customers who come through the government marketplaces. That means customers don’t even have the option of paying straight away. Also, while customers may not have paid, most states require a grace period of 30 or 31 days where insurers are required to pay claims.  So maybe they don’t intend to pay and will eventually lose their coverage. But for now, they are treated as if they were enrolled. And they did a lot more than just load up an online shopping cart. We rate Trump’s  ."

He received 47.8 percent of the vote in defeating Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who came in at 45.2 percent. Robert Sarvis, a Libertarian, finished a distant third with 6.5 percent.
McAuliffe's inaguration as Virginia's 72nd governor is scheduled on Jan. 11, 2014.

Clinton’s State Department approved Russia’s purchase of a company with uranium assets in the United States but it was one of 11 organizations to do so.

The allegations in this Facebook post range from the —comparing Ocasio-Cortez to an amphibian—to the incendiary. But all of the claims, including the ones we didn’t check, are  because they’re presented as if they are uncontested facts, and that’s not the case. The burden of proof is high in claiming someone paid a minor for sex, and in the case of Menendez, that proof is missing. The allegations against Ellison are murkier. We know that, while in law school, Ellison wrote an  article defending Louis Farrakhan against claims that Farrakhan was anti-semitic. Ellison then went on to renounce the Nation of Islam while also addressing those criticisms head-on in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. It seems clear that while this  contains an element of , it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. As to the  that Ellison ""beats women,"" we know that Ellison has not been convicted of assault in a court of law. However, his former partner hasn’t backed down from claims that he harmed her in what was clearly a volatile relationship. Without more , it is hard to rule on this matter.
